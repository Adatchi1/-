Barricades - 澤野弘之 (さわの ひろゆき)/R!N/Gemie/mpi/Yosh
Wouldn't it be nice to take a walk on
Some pure white sand gaze at the horizon
Without living in fear
Wouldn't it be sweet to watch the sun curve down meet the waves
And taste the ocean spray and realize
We'd been living as slaves
We've got to learn to
Get back get back
But is it worth the price of our soul
You know you had to
Kill her kill her
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades
And if we
Get out get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to
Live free live free
We'll live a life without barricades
How long I haven't seen the light shine through in my life
Lost everything
Family confusion on the way
Someone tries to talk to me and signpost the righteous road
My animal inside
Can now be tamed to go
Over the wall
We've got to learn to
Get back get back
But is it worth the price of our soul
You know you had to
Kill her kill her
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades
And if we
Get out get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to
Live free live free
We'll live a life without barricades
We've got to learn to
Get back get back
But is it worth the price of our soul
You know you had to
Kill her kill her
Oh my dirty hands
It never fades
And if we
Get out get out
I'll think about the price of our soul
We've got to learn to
Live free live free
We'll live a life without barricades
